Squaremory

Purpose:

This is a browser based game which was built using html, css and JavaScript.

Instructions & Description:

The game begins on a start page which gives brief instructions for the game, and a link to the actual game.

when the player clicks start the player has 4 seconds to memorise the squares before they disappear and once they have disappear the player has to click on the squares they remember before the time runs out. if they find all the squares before the time runs out. the player has to click done to move on.

To click on the squares the user just needs to use their mouse.

Improvements:
Some improvements that could be made, would be to have seperate easy, medium and hard levels, and have different colour squares come up.
